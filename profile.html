	<h1>Profile
	<p>Harshad Mehta, also known as the "Big Bull," was a stockbroker who gained prominence in the Indian stock market in the late 1980s and early 1990s. He was known for his charismatic personality and his unconventional yet successful strategy in the stock market. Mehta capitalized on the loopholes in the banking system, specifically exploiting ready forward (RF) deals, to artificially inflate the stock market and cause massive price increases in certain stocks.
	<p>Mehta's modus operandi involved exploiting banking instruments to manipulate stock prices. He used a network of banks and brokers to circulate funds in the form of massive loans, creating artificial demand for certain stocks and driving up their prices. This practice, known as 'pump and dump,' inflated the prices of certain stocks, creating a false sense of their value. Mehta's scam was discovered when the State Bank of India tightened its regulations on the banking sector, exposing the discrepancies in the transactions and alerting authorities to the massive fraud that had been taking place.
